# Welcome to Your New Blog!

This is your first blog post. The blog-static starter is a simple, flat-file blog system that uses Markdown files for content.

## How It Works

Posts are stored as Markdown files in the `data/posts/` directory. Each file should be named with the format:

```
YYYY-MM-DD-post-slug.md
```

The date prefix helps with sorting, and the slug becomes part of the URL.

## Writing Posts

You can use standard Markdown syntax:

* Use `*` or `-` for bullet lists
* Use `1.` for numbered lists
* Use `**bold**` and `*italic*` for emphasis
* Use backticks for `inline code`
* Use triple backticks for code blocks

## Next Steps

1. Edit this file to customize your first post
2. Add new posts by creating more `.md` files
3. Customize the design in `public/assets/style.css`
4. Update the About page in `public/about.php`

Happy blogging!
